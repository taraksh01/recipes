    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      These muffins toe the line between muffin and cupcake but are delicious
      nonetheless. The vanilla poppy seed muffin base contrasts nicely with the
      tart rhubarb.
    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>1/2 cup unsalted butter, softened</li>
      <li>1 1/4 cups white sugar</li>
      <li>3 large eggs, at room temperature</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon vanilla extract</li>
      <li>1/4 teaspoon almond extract</li>
      <li>2 cups all-purpose flour</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon poppy seeds</li>
      <li>2 teaspoons baking powder</li>
      <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
      <li>1/4 teaspoon ground nutmeg</li>
      <li>1 cup plain whole milk Greek yogurt</li>
      <li>1 1/2 cups finely chopped rhubarb</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Preheat the oven to 200 degrees C. Line two muffin pans with liners..
      </li>
      <li>
        In a large bowl, beat butter and sugar together until light and fluffy,
        2 to 3 minutes. Add in eggs 1 at a time, beating well after each
        addition. Turn the mixer speed up to medium-high, and beat batter until
        it is very light and fluffy, and has lightened in color, about 5
        minutes. Mix in vanilla and almond extracts.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add in 1 cup flour, poppy seeds, baking powder, salt and nutmeg and mix
        on low speed until just combined. Add in yogurt and mix until just
        combined. Add in remaining 1 cup flour and mix until just incorporated.
        Fold chopped rhubarb.
      </li>
      <li>
        Divide batter between the lined muffin cups, filling each one about 3/4
        full.
      </li>
      <li>
        Bake in the preheated over until muffins spring back lightly when
        touched, 20 to 23 minutes. Allow muffins to cool in the pan a few
        minutes before removing to a wire rack to cool completely.
      </li>
